# 3. Simplicity Is Key
I discovered Jekyll when I was looking to rebuild my game studio's website. My first Jekyll site was simple; it was for myself, it was built with the default theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima){:target="_blank"}, and it was my first foray into web design after a while of not using WordPress. Overall, the first version is pretty different to what you see now, but that's not the main point. This section will explore how to incorporate simplicity into your sites.

When it comes to web design, less is often more. Early on, I found myself overcomplicating the Portfolio section, experimenting with a [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/){:target="_blank"}-powered carousel that didn't appear to look good out of the box. It wasn't until I settled for a grid design that my site started to shine brighter; it seemed more complete as a single page site!

#### Tips for Simplicity in Web Design
1. **Focus on Functionality**: Prioritize features that enhance user experience over flashy extras.
2. **White Space Is Your Friend**: Don’t be afraid to leave areas of your design empty. It creates balance.
3. **Consistency Is Key**: Stick to a limited color palette and font family for a polished look.

Remember, simplicity doesn’t mean boring. It means thoughtful design. Try these tips in your next project and see how much of a difference they make!
